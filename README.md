# Cinnamon 4.0 has now the feature to have someting like cobi (in my opinion better) and the official Vivaldi Theme got updated to support it, i will no longer support this here.
# Cinnamon Vivaldi Modded
Its a Modded Cinnamon Theme, original from [freemangilgamesh](https://github.com/freemangilgamesh/cinnamon-spices-themes/tree/master/Vivaldi)

Whats modified:
- Mainly it has now an "Open" Indicator for [Cobi-Window-List](https://github.com/Cobinja/CobiWindowList)
